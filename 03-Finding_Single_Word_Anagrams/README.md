# Finding-Single-Word-Anagrams

<p> An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. For example,
Elvis yields the eerie trio evils, lives, and veils.
Does this mean Elvis still lives but veils his evil
existence? In the book Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets, “I am Lord Voldemort” is an anagram of the
evil wizard’s real name, Tom Marvolo Riddle. “Lord
Earldom Vomit” is also an anagram of Tom Marvolo
Riddle, but author J.K. Rowling had the good sense to
pass on that one
